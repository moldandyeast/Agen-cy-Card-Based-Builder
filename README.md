# ⬢ Agen[+]cy Studio: The Generative UI Architect

> **Version:** 2.0 (Obsidian Release)
> **Engine:** Google Gemini 3 Pro + Gemini 2.5 Flash
> **Stack:** React 19, Tailwind CSS, Lucide

## 🚀 Executive Summary
Agen[+]cy is not just a website builder; it is a **Gamified Creative Engine**. It reimagines frontend engineering by abstracting complex code into collectible, tradable, and composable "Assets" (Cards).

Users act as **Creative Directors**, curating a "Deck" of UI components, Visual Themes, and Voice Personas. The AI (The Architect) then synthesizes these distinct atomic elements into a cohesive, production-grade Single Page Application (SPA).

## ✨ Core Ecosystem

### 1. The Asset Library (Gacha & Forge)
The application relies on a robust library of UI components.
- **The Pack Drop (Gacha):** Users open "Blind Packs" generated by **Gemini 2.5 Flash**. This creates serendipity, offering random layouts, experimental effects, and rare "Holographic" components (Three.js/Canvas).
- **The Component Forge (Direct):** A precise fabrication tool. Users prompt specific needs (e.g., "A retro-futuristic countdown timer"), and the AI mints a custom Card instantly.

### 2. The Deck Strategy
Building a site is a strategic choice. You are limited to:
- **5 UI Structure Cards:** (e.g., Navbar, Hero, Features, Grid, Footer).
- **1 Visual Theme:** Defines the global CSS variables (:root), typography, and color palette.
- **∞ Voice Layers:** Defines the copywriting persona (e.g., "Gen-Z Chaos" + "Professional Corp").

### 3. The Architect (Assembly Engine)
Powered by **Gemini 3 Pro**, the Assembler does not simply concatenate code. It:
- **Ingests** the raw HTML/CSS/JS from selected cards.
- **Harmonizes** conflicting styles using the selected Theme Card.
- **Rewrites** all dummy text using the active Voice Cards.
- **Outputs** a single, self-contained `agency_site.html` file ready for deployment.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Component Sandboxing
Every Card in the UI is rendered inside a scaled `iframe` with isolated CSS scopes. This ensures that a "Bootstrap" card doesn't visually break a "Tailwind" card while in the gallery.

### The "Single-File" Output
The final export is a masterful piece of engineering. It bundles:
- Semantic HTML5 structure.
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for layout.
- Embedded CSS for specific component styles.
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.
- **Zero Build Steps required for the end-user.**

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone & Install**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Intelligence**
   Create a `.env` file (or set via environment variables):
   ```env
   API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
   ```

3. **Launch Studio**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🔮 Roadmap v3
- **Multi-Page Routing:** Stacking decks to create full sitemaps.
- **P2P Marketplace:** Export cards as JSON to trade with other developers.
- **Code Refiner:** Chat with the Architect to iterate on specific sections of the generated build.
